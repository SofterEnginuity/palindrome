# ↔️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Server Side Palindrome Checker

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.
Palindrome Checker
Check to see if any word is a palindrome (the same forward and backwards)


## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, Javascript & Node

This project was built as I was learning server and api management.

## Lessons Learned:
There was a lot of "which side does this function go on?" happening with this project. I do think the trial and error was fun and it helped me learn what goes where!
